        <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
        <p>It has been a <em>very</em> busy week. Next week is going to be <strong>extremely stressful</strong> week since it have lots of big tests and midterms within a very short time frame. It will be <em>difficult</em> but I think I will manage fine, I <strong>get through</strong> next week.</p>

        <h2>... Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>I think elements from part c are a better choice then i and b tags for a few reasons. Firstly, for the b tag, I feel that the strong tag puts a greater emphasis on a word of phrase that im trying to say, that i want to be a greater presence. The b tag I feel does not really convey a similar message, its more up to interpretation with the b tag. Secondly, for the i tag, its simply to italicize text, with now significant meaning. The em tag however, is a great tool to draw attention to a word or phrase, then a regular sentence could. </p>
