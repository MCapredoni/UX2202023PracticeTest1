    <h1> html vs Google Docs Article</h1>
    <x-markdown2html>
There is a few key differences between html and google docs. Firstly with google docs, it is at heart just a document creator and editor. It allows you to stylize you text without requiring any experience with any coding language. Html however will require some some training, and not a simple to use. What makes html a better, is that it allows the user to express themselves significantly more, but it also allows for more control not just on the text, but it also allows users to edit the page as a whole. In html you can edit things such as page color or add interactive images, etc.
